# TestYourResistors
### A simple game made to test your resistor knowledge

## Why?
I used this project as an opportunity to combine learning the resistor color codes with Astro. I have made most of my sites in Vanilla JS, ReactJS, or NextJS, so I wanted to learn a new framework by completing a simple project such as this.

## How to Use:
1) Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lbcmk/TestYourResistors
```

2) Install the Dependancies
```bash
npm install
```

3) Run the local dev version
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Built using
- Astro
- Vercel
